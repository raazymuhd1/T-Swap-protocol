# Low Issues

## L-1: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 313](src\TSwapPool.sol#L313)

	```solidity
	    function swapExactInput(
	```



## L-2: Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals

If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 277](src\TSwapPool.sol#L277)

	```solidity
	        uint256 inputAmountMinusFee = inputAmount * 997;
	```

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 310](src\TSwapPool.sol#L310)

	```solidity
	            ((outputReserves - outputAmount) * 997);
	```

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 471](src\TSwapPool.sol#L471)

	```solidity
	                1e18,
	```

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 480](src\TSwapPool.sol#L480)

	```solidity
	                1e18,
	```



## L-3: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

- Found in src/PoolFactory.sol [Line: 35](src\PoolFactory.sol#L35)

	```solidity
	    event PoolCreated(address tokenAddress, address poolAddress);
	```

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 52](src\TSwapPool.sol#L52)

	```solidity
	    event LiquidityAdded(
	```

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 57](src\TSwapPool.sol#L57)

	```solidity
	    event LiquidityRemoved(
	```

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 62](src\TSwapPool.sol#L62)

	```solidity
	    event Swap(
	```



## L-4: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in src/PoolFactory.sol [Line: 15](src\PoolFactory.sol#L15)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity 0.8.20;
	```

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 15](src\TSwapPool.sol#L15)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity 0.8.20;
	```



## L-5: Large literal values multiples of 10000 can be replaced with scientific notation

Use `e` notation, for example: `1e18`, instead of its full numeric value.

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 309](src\TSwapPool.sol#L309)

	```solidity
	            ((inputReserves * outputAmount) * 10000) /
	```
